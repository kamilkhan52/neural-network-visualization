# Neural Network Visualization Analysis

## Initial State Visualizations

### Sample Images (sample_images.png)
This visualization shows a 3x3 grid of randomly selected MNIST digits from our dataset. Key observations:
- Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale
- The images are normalized (pixel values between 0 and 1)
- Labels show the actual digit each image represents
- This helps verify:
  1. Data loading is correct
  2. Image normalization is working
  3. Labels are properly aligned with images

### Weight Distributions (weight_distribution.png)
Shows the initial weight distributions for both layers of our neural network:

#### Layer 1 (Input → Hidden)
- Shape: 784×128 (100,352 weights)
- Normal distribution centered at 0, scaled by 0.01
- Expected range: roughly [-0.03, 0.03]
- Small scale prevents initial saturation

#### Layer 2 (Hidden → Output)
- Shape: 128×10 (1,280 weights)
- Similar distribution to Layer 1
- Smaller number of parameters
- Symmetric around zero

## Training Progress Visualizations

### Layer Activations (activations_epoch_X.png)
Generated at epochs [0, 2, 4], showing:

#### Hidden Layer (ReLU)
What to look for:
- Initial state: Many neurons at 0 (ReLU clipping)
- During training: 
  - Distribution should spread out
  - Fewer neurons should be "dead" (always 0)
  - Right tail should extend as features are learned

#### Output Layer (Softmax)
What to look for:
- Initial state: Nearly uniform distribution (~0.1 for each class)
- During training:
  - Should become more peaked
  - Higher confidence predictions (values closer to 0 or 1)
  - Distribution should become more bimodal

### Gradient Flow (gradients_epoch_X.png)
Shows gradient magnitudes for each layer:

#### What to Look For
- Initial gradients should be relatively large
- Should decrease over time as model converges
- Layer 1 vs Layer 2 differences:
  - Layer 1 typically has smaller gradients (gradient diminishing)
  - Layer 2 gradients more directly reflect prediction errors

### Training Progress (training_progress.png)
Shows loss and accuracy over epochs:

#### Loss Curve
What to look for:
- Should decrease rapidly at first
- Gradually levels off
- Smooth curve indicates stable training
- Sharp spikes suggest potential instability

#### Accuracy Curve
What to look for:
- Should increase over time
- Plateaus indicate learning saturation
- Final accuracy indicates model performance

### Prediction Confidence (confidence_epoch_X.png)
Shows the model's confidence in its predictions:

#### Correct Predictions
What to look for:
- Initially: Low confidence (near 0.1)
- During training: 
  - Shift towards higher confidence
  - Peak should move right
  - Distribution should become more peaked

#### Incorrect Predictions
What to look for:
- Should have lower confidence than correct predictions
- High confidence wrong predictions indicate overconfidence
- Distribution should be more spread out than correct predictions

## Interpreting Training Progress

### Good Training Signs
1. Loss consistently decreasing
2. Accuracy increasing
3. Activation distributions spreading out appropriately
4. Gradient magnitudes gradually decreasing
5. Increasing confidence in correct predictions

### Warning Signs
1. Loss increasing or oscillating
2. Many "dead" ReLU neurons (stuck at 0)
3. Very large or very small gradients
4. High confidence in wrong predictions
5. No change in activation distributions

### Optimization Opportunities
1. Learning rate adjustment if:
   - Loss oscillates → Decrease learning rate
   - Loss decreases too slowly → Increase learning rate
2. Architecture changes if:
   - Many dead neurons → Reduce network size
   - Poor accuracy → Increase network size
3. Initialization adjustments if:
   - Initial activations are saturated
   - Initial gradients are too small/large

## Using These Visualizations
- Compare visualizations across epochs to track learning
- Use as debugging tools when performance is poor
- Guide hyperparameter tuning decisions
- Understand the network's learning dynamics
